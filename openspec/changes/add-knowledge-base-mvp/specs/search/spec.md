# Search Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Full-Text Search
The system SHALL provide full-text search across document titles and content.

#### Scenario: Search by keyword
- **WHEN** a user searches for a keyword
- **THEN** the system returns all documents containing that keyword in title or content
- **AND** the system highlights matching terms in the results
- **AND** the system ranks results by relevance

#### Scenario: Multi-word search
- **WHEN** a user searches with multiple words
- **THEN** the system treats it as an AND query (all words must be present)
- **AND** the system supports quoted phrases for exact matching

#### Scenario: Case-insensitive search
- **WHEN** a user performs a search
- **THEN** the system matches keywords regardless of case
- **AND** the system preserves original case in results

### Requirement: Tag-Based Search
The system SHALL support filtering documents by tags, including hierarchical tag queries.

#### Scenario: Filter by single tag
- **WHEN** a user filters by a specific tag
- **THEN** the system returns all documents associated with that tag
- **AND** the system respects tag hierarchy (see tag-management spec)

#### Scenario: Filter by multiple tags
- **WHEN** a user filters by multiple tags
- **THEN** the system returns documents that have ALL specified tags (AND logic)
- **AND** the system supports OR logic when explicitly requested

#### Scenario: Combine text and tag search
- **WHEN** a user provides both keywords and tag filters
- **THEN** the system returns documents matching both criteria

### Requirement: Semantic Search
The system SHALL provide AI-powered semantic search to find conceptually similar documents.

#### Scenario: Semantic similarity query
- **WHEN** a user performs a semantic search with a natural language query
- **THEN** the system returns documents with similar meaning, not just exact keyword matches
- **AND** the system ranks results by semantic similarity score

#### Scenario: Find related documents
- **WHEN** a user requests documents related to a specific document
- **THEN** the system finds semantically similar documents
- **AND** the system excludes the query document from results

### Requirement: Search Result Ranking
The system SHALL rank search results by relevance using a combination of factors.

#### Scenario: Relevance ranking
- **WHEN** a user performs a search
- **THEN** the system ranks results by keyword frequency, position, recency, and semantic similarity
- **AND** the system allows sorting by different criteria (relevance, date, title)

### Requirement: Search Performance
The system SHALL return search results in under 500ms for databases with fewer than 10,000 documents.

#### Scenario: Fast search response
- **WHEN** a user performs a search on a database with < 10,000 documents
- **THEN** the system returns results in less than 500ms

### Requirement: Search Result Summary
The system SHALL provide contextual snippets showing where search terms appear in documents.

#### Scenario: Result snippets
- **WHEN** search results are returned
- **THEN** each result includes a snippet showing the matching text with surrounding context
- **AND** the system highlights the matching keywords in the snippet

### Requirement: Current Version Only
The system SHALL search only the current version of each document, excluding historical versions.

#### Scenario: Search excludes old versions
- **WHEN** a user performs any search
- **THEN** the system searches only the current version of each document
- **AND** the system ignores content from historical versions

### Requirement: Search Filters
The system SHALL support additional search filters including date ranges and document metadata.

#### Scenario: Filter by date range
- **WHEN** a user specifies a date range filter
- **THEN** the system returns only documents created or modified within that range

#### Scenario: Combine multiple filters
- **WHEN** a user applies multiple filters (tags, dates, keywords)
- **THEN** the system applies all filters with AND logic

### Requirement: No Results Handling
The system SHALL provide helpful feedback when searches return no results.

#### Scenario: Zero results
- **WHEN** a search returns no matching documents
- **THEN** the system returns an empty result set with a clear message
- **AND** the system suggests related tags or alternative search terms when possible

### Requirement: Search Query Validation
The system SHALL validate search queries and provide clear error messages for invalid input.

#### Scenario: Invalid search query
- **WHEN** a user submits an invalid search query (e.g., SQL injection attempt, malformed regex)
- **THEN** the system rejects the query with a validation error
- **AND** the system protects against injection attacks

### Requirement: Search Analytics
The system SHALL track search queries for improving suggestions and understanding user needs.

#### Scenario: Log search queries
- **WHEN** a user performs a search
- **THEN** the system logs the query, result count, and timestamp
- **AND** the system uses this data to improve future search suggestions
