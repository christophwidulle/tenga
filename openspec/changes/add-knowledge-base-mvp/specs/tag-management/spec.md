# Tag Management Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Hierarchical Tags
The system SHALL support hierarchical tags with parent-child relationships to enable grouped organization of documents.

#### Scenario: Create tag with parent
- **WHEN** a user creates or assigns a tag with a specified parent tag
- **THEN** the system establishes the parent-child relationship
- **AND** the system allows querying documents by parent tag to include all child tags

#### Scenario: Tag without parent
- **WHEN** a user creates a root-level tag without a parent
- **THEN** the system stores it as a top-level tag in the hierarchy

### Requirement: Automatic Tag Extraction
The system SHALL automatically extract and suggest tags from document content during creation and updates.

#### Scenario: Auto-tag on document creation
- **WHEN** a user creates a document without explicitly specifying tags
- **THEN** the system analyzes the content and suggests relevant tags
- **AND** the user can accept, modify, or reject the suggestions

#### Scenario: Auto-tag with existing tags
- **WHEN** the system suggests tags that already exist in the hierarchy
- **THEN** the system reuses existing tags and their relationships
- **AND** the system does not create duplicate tags

### Requirement: Tag CRUD Operations
The system SHALL provide create, read, update, and delete operations for tags.

#### Scenario: Create new tag
- **WHEN** a user creates a new tag with a name and optional parent
- **THEN** the system validates uniqueness within the same parent context
- **AND** the system persists the tag with its hierarchy information

#### Scenario: Rename tag
- **WHEN** a user renames a tag
- **THEN** the system updates the tag name across all associated documents
- **AND** the system preserves parent-child relationships

#### Scenario: Delete unused tag
- **WHEN** a user deletes a tag that has no associated documents
- **THEN** the system removes the tag from the hierarchy

#### Scenario: Delete tag with documents
- **WHEN** a user attempts to delete a tag that has associated documents
- **THEN** the system requires confirmation or reassignment of documents
- **AND** the system preserves data integrity

### Requirement: Tag Association
The system SHALL allow associating multiple tags with a single document.

#### Scenario: Add tag to document
- **WHEN** a user adds a tag to a document
- **THEN** the system creates the association
- **AND** the system includes the document in tag-based queries

#### Scenario: Remove tag from document
- **WHEN** a user removes a tag from a document
- **THEN** the system removes the association
- **AND** the system excludes the document from queries for that tag

### Requirement: Tag Hierarchy Query
The system SHALL support filtering documents by tag hierarchy, including all child tags when querying by parent tag.

#### Scenario: Query by parent tag
- **WHEN** a user filters documents by a parent tag
- **THEN** the system returns all documents tagged with the parent tag OR any of its child tags
- **AND** the system includes nested child tags (grandchildren, etc.)

#### Scenario: Query by child tag
- **WHEN** a user filters documents by a child tag
- **THEN** the system returns only documents tagged with that specific child tag
- **AND** the system does not include documents tagged only with the parent

### Requirement: Tag Listing
The system SHALL provide listing of all tags with their hierarchy information.

#### Scenario: List all tags
- **WHEN** a user requests all tags
- **THEN** the system returns tags with parent-child relationships
- **AND** the system includes document count for each tag

#### Scenario: List root tags
- **WHEN** a user requests only root-level tags
- **THEN** the system returns tags without parents
- **AND** the system includes their child tag counts

### Requirement: Tag Validation
The system SHALL validate tag operations to prevent circular dependencies and maintain hierarchy integrity.

#### Scenario: Prevent circular parent relationship
- **WHEN** a user attempts to set a tag's parent to one of its descendants
- **THEN** the system rejects the operation with a validation error

#### Scenario: Enforce unique tag names per level
- **WHEN** a user creates a tag with a name that already exists at the same hierarchy level
- **THEN** the system suggests using the existing tag or choosing a different name
